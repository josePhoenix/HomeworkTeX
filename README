HomeworkTeX
===================

The HomeworkTeX package is a very simple set of LaTeX environments to help you
format your homework. A quick overview of the environments in the package is
included below. A working example is available in example.tex.

INSTALLATION

For Mac users running the standard LaTeX distribution, make sure the
~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/ directory exists, and copy or symlink the
HomeworkTeX folder into it.

(For others, find the TEXMF directory for your distribution, and copy or symlink the HomeworkTeX folder into it.)

OVERVIEW

Here are all the environments HomeworkTeX provides (intended to be used
between a \begin{document} and \end{document})

-------------------

\begin{solutionset} -- Sets up the problem counter

\begin{problem} -- Shows the problem in a nice box with a number
\end{problem}

\begin{solution} -- Shows a solution with a little black square dingbat at the
                    end to indicate you're finished
\end{solution}

\begin{stepsolution} -- Similar to the above, except it lets you separate your
                        solution into steps with the \step command
  \step Lorem ipsum
  \step Dolor sit amet
\end{stepsolution}

\end{solutionset}
